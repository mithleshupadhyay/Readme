# Docker Tutorial

## Introduction
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package an application with all of its dependencies, ensuring consistency across multiple environments.

## Prerequisites
- Install Docker: [Download Here](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Install Docker Compose: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Basic knowledge of command-line usage

---

## Writing a Dockerfile
A `Dockerfile` is a script that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.

### Example `Dockerfile`
This is a simple example for a Python application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

---

## Building a Docker Image
To create a Docker image from the `Dockerfile`, navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run:

```sh
docker build -t my-python-app .
```

Here, `-t my-python-app` tags the image with the name `my-python-app`.

---

## Running a Docker Container
Once the image is built, run it as a container using:

```sh
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
```

- `-p 5000:5000` maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on your machine.
- `my-python-app` is the name of the image to run.

---

## Checking Running Containers
To see all running containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

To stop a running container:

```sh
docker stop <container_id>
```

To remove a container:

```sh
docker rm <container_id>
```

---

## Removing Images
To remove an image:

```sh
docker rmi my-python-app
```

---

## Using Docker Compose
Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications with a simple YAML file.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Running with Docker Compose

To start your application using Docker Compose, run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

To stop the application:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

## Conclusion
This was a basic introduction to Docker, covering how to write a Dockerfile, build an image, run a container, and use Docker Compose. Docker simplifies the process of application deployment and ensures a consistent environment.
